Waterfall Model : 
Requirement Analysis
System Design
Implementation
Testing
Deployment
Maintanance

Advantage of Waterfall Model : 
1.Quality of product will be good.
2.Since Rwquirement changes are not allowed, changes of finding bugs will be less.
3.Initial invesment is less since the tester are hired at the later stages.
4.Preferred for small projects where requirement are freezed.

Disadvantages of waterfall model : 
1.Requirement changes are not allowed.
2.If there is defect in REquirement that will be continued in later phases.
Total investment is more because time taking for rework on defect is time consuming which leads to high investment.
Testing will startc only after coding.

Spiral Model : 
Spiral Model is Iterative model.
Spiral model overcome drawdacks of waterfall model.
We follow spiral model whenever there is dependency on the modules.
In every cycle new software will be released to customer.
Software will be released in multiple versions. So it is called version control model.

Advantages of Spiral Model : 
Testing is done in every cycle , before going to next cycle.
Customer will get to use the software for every module.
Requirement changes are allowed after every cycle before going to next cycle.

Disadvantages of Spiral model :
Requirement changes are not allowed in between the cycle.
Every cycle of spiral model looks like waterfall model.
There is no testing in requirement and design phase.




Prototype Model : 
Initial requirements from the customer ---> Prototype ----> Customer ----> Design, Coding, Testing ....

Modules : 
Gmail : 
login
inbox
compose
sent
receive mail  etc

Banking : 
Login
Check Balance
Fund transfer
Req Statement
Add Payee
etc

V- Model/ VV Model :

Static Testing : 
Testing the project related documents is called as static testing.
Review
Walthrough
inspection

Dynamic Testing : 
Testing the actual software.
Unit testing
Integeration
System testing 
UAT


Verification and Validation : 
Verification checks whether we bulding the right product.
Focus on Documentation.
Verification typically involves.
Reviews
Walkthrough
Inspections

Validation : 
Checks whether we are bulding the product right.
Focus on software
Validation typically involves actual testing.
Unit testing, integeration, system testing. UAT testing.

Advantages : 
Testing is involve in each and every phase.

Disadvantage : 
Documentation is more
Initial investment is more.

Static Testing Techniques : 
Review
Walkthrough
Inspection

Dynamic Testing Techniques : 
Unit Testing
Integeration Testing
System Testing
UAT : User acceptance Testing

Review : 
Conducts on documents  to ensure correctness and completeness.

Requirement Reviews
Design Reviews
Code Reviews
Test Plan Reviews
Test cases revies etc.

Walkthrough : 
It is informal review
Author reads the documents or code and discuss with peers
It's not pre-planned and can be done whenever required.
Also walkthorugh does not have minutes of the meet.

Inspection : 
Its a most formal review type.
In which at least 3-8 people will sit in the meeting 1-reader 2-writer 3-moderator plus concerned.
Inspection will have a proper schedule which will be intimated via email to the concerened developer tester.

QA : 
Quality Assurance (QA) is a systematic process designed to determine whether a product or service meets specified requirements. It is a proactive approach that helps you prevent defects before they occur. Testing, a component of QA, is the practice of executing a program or application to find errors.
QA is process related.
QA focuses on preventing defects.
QA for entire lifecycle.
QA focuses on building in quality.
People : QC(Testers)
Process  : QA
Product :  

QC : 
Quality control (QC) is a procedure or set of procedures intended to ensure that a manufactured product or performed service adheres to a defined set of quality criteria or meets the requirements of the client or customer. QC is similar to, but not identical with, quality assurance (QA).

QC focuses on testing for quality.
QC is actual testing of software.
QC is product oriented.
QC for testing part of SDLC.
QC focuses on testing for quality.

Unit Testing :
A unit is a single component or module of a software.
Unit Testing conducts on a single programm or single module.
Unit testing is white box testing techniques.
Unit testing is conducted by developers.

Unit testing techniques : 
Basis path testing
control structure testing
conditional coverage
Loops coverage
Mutation testing


a = 20 b = 10
if a > b
	print a is largest
else
	print b is largest

1...5 numbers

i=1
max = 10

while(i<=10)
{
  print i
i=i+1
}
if user = "dharti" and password="123"
	allow login
else
	not allow login

Integeration Testing : 

Integeration testing performed between 2 or more modules.
Integeration testing focuses on checking data communication between multiple modules.
Integerated testing is white box testing technique.

Types of integeration testing :
Incremental Integeration testing 
Non-incrmental integeration testing

Incremental Integeration testing  : 
Incrementally  adding the modules and testing the data flow between modules.

2 Approaches : 
Top Down
Bottom Up

Top Down Incrmental Integeration Testing : 
Incrementally adding the modules and testing the data flow between the modules. And ensure the module added is the child of previous module.

Bottom Up Incremental Integeration testing : 
Incementally adding the modules and testing the data flow between the modules. And ensure the module added is parent of the previous module.

Sandwich/Hybrid Approach : Combination of Top-Down and Bottom Up approach is called sandiwch approach.

Non incremental Integeration testing : 
Adding all the modules in a single shot and test the data flow beteen modules.

Drawbacks : 
We might miss data flow between some of the modules.
If you find any defect we cant understand the root cause of defect.


Agile model/ Agile Methodology/ Agile Process

It is an Iterative and Incremental Approach.

Agile is an Iterative and Incremental Process.

Deliver Software in Piece of requirements : 

Agile Principles : 

1. Customers no need to wait for long time.
2. We develop , test and release piece of software to the customer with few number of features.
3.We can accept /accomodate requirement changes.


There Will be good communication between Customer, Business Analyst, Developer and Testers.
 
Advantages : 
Requirement changes are allowed in any stage of development or we can accomodate requirement changes in the middle of development.
Release will be very fast.
Customer no need to wait for long time.
Good communication between teams.
It is very easy model to adopt.

Disadvantages : 
Less Focus on design and documentation since we deliver software very faster.


Agile is defined process.

Scrum : kind of framework

Scrum is a framework through which we build software product by following Agile Principles.
Scrum includes group of people calles as Scrum team. Norammly contains 5-9 members.

1. Product Owner
2. Scrum Master
3. Dev Team
4. QA  Team


Product Owner : 
	Define the features of the product
	Prioritize features according to the market value
	Adjust features and priority  on every iteration , as needed.
	Accept or reject work results.

Scrum Master : 
	The main role is faciliating and driving the agile process.
	
Deevelopers and QA : 
	Develop and Test the software


Scrum Terminology : 
User Story : A feature/module in a software

Epic : Collection of user stories

Product Backlog : Contains list of user stories. Prepared by Product Owner.

Sprint/Iteration  : Period of time to complete the user stories, decided b y the product owner and team , usually 2-4 week of time.

Sprint planning meeting : Meeting conducts with the team to define what can be delivered in the sprint and duration.

Sprint Backlog : List of commited stories by Dev/QA for specific sprint.

Scrum Meeting :  Meeting conducted by Scrum master everday 15 mins. Called as Scrum call/ Standup meeting.
		What did you do yesterday ?
		what will you do today?
		Are there any impediments in your way?

Sprint retrospective meeting  : conducts meeting after completion of sprint. The entire team , including both the Scrummaster and the product owner should participate.

Story point : Rough estimation of user stoires , will be given by Dev and QA in the form of Fibonacci Series.

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 ......

1 story point  = 1 hour / 1 day(6 hour)
Login -----> Dev - 5 QA - 3  = 8 hours/ 1 day

Burndown chart : Shows how much work remaining in the sprint. Maintained by the scrum master daily.

Scrum Development  : Agile Methodology

Process : Scrum Projects are organized in ahort iterations, during which the team works to add incremental value to the end of the product.
